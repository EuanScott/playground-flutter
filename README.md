# Playground Flutter
A simple Flutter App for trying out the Flutter Framework.

There is no goal/plan behind this app. It is purely a place to try out the framework for the 1st time.

[Deprecated] in favour of [project-tweety](https://github.com/EuanScott/project-tweety) as I did not work on this for a long time, which resulted in a number of build and versioning issues.
